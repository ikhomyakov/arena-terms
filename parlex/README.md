Runtime support library for lexers and parsers generated by [parlex-gen](https://crates.io/crates/parlex-gen).

## Overview

`parlex` is the core runtime library that defines generic traits and data structures to support lexers and parsers generated by `alex` and `aslr` from the `parlex-gen` crate.

Generated lexers and parsers depend on this crate at runtime. Users build their own custom lexers and parsers based on the generated code, using the traits and data structures defined here.

## Features

- Generic traits for lexical analysis and parsing
- Core data structures used by generated code
- Foundation for building custom lexers and parsers

## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
parlex = "0.1"
```

This crate is typically used in conjunction with code generated by `parlex-gen`. See the [parlex-gen documentation](https://docs.rs/parlex-gen) for information on generating lexers and parsers.

## Example

```rust
use parlex::*;

// Your generated lexer and parser code will use parlex traits and types
// Example usage depends on your specific grammar and generated code
```
