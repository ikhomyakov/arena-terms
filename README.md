Lexer and parser generator tools with runtime support library.

## Overview

Parlex is a set of Rust tools for generating efficient lexers and parsers. The project consists of two complementary crates: a code generation toolset and a runtime support library that work together to provide a complete parsing solution.

## Crates

### ðŸ“¦ [parlex](./parlex)

The core runtime library that defines generic traits and data structures to support lexers and parsers generated by `parlex-gen`. This crate provides:

- Generic traits for lexical analysis and parsing
- Core data structures used by generated code

Generated lexers and parsers depend on this crate at runtime. Users build their own custom lexers and parsers based on the generated code, using the traits and data structures defined here.

**Add to your `Cargo.toml`:**
```toml
[dependencies]
parlex = "0.1"
```

### ðŸ”§ [parlex-gen](./parlex-gen)

The code generation toolset that provides two generators:

- **`alex`**: Regex-based lexer generator for creating tokenizers from lexical specifications
- **`aslr`**: SLR parser generator for building parsers from grammar definitions

Both generators produce code that uses the `parlex` runtime library.

**Features:**
- Generate regex-based lexers with `alex`
- Generate SLR parsers with `aslr`
- Generated code uses parlex traits and data structures

**Add to your `Cargo.toml`:**
```toml
[build-dependencies]
parlex-gen = "0.1"
```

## Architecture

The parlex toolset follows a two-phase approach:

1. **Build time**: Use `alex` and `aslr` from `parlex-gen` to generate lexer and parser code from your specifications
2. **Runtime**: The generated code uses the `parlex` runtime library for execution

## Building & testing

At the repository root:

```bash
cargo build
cargo test
```

You can also build/test an individual crate with `-p`, e.g.:

```bash
cargo test -p parlex
```
